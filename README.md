The library allows to construct, render, and parse CUE sheets.

## What is CUE sheet?

> A cue sheet, or cue file, is a metadata file which describes how the
> tracks of a CD or DVD are laid out. Cue sheets are stored as plain text
> files and commonly have a “.cue” filename extension. CDRWIN first
> introduced cue sheets, which are now supported by many optical disc
> authoring applications and media players.

The description of the format can be found
[here](https://wayback.archive.org/web/20070614044112/http://www.goldenhawk.com/download/cdrwin.pdf),
scroll to the appendix A (it's closest we get to a “specification”).

## Quick start

[Read the Haddocks](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cue-sheet). In
short, you parse a `CueSheet` with `parseCueSheet` function and render a
`CueSheet` with `renderCueSheet` function—pretty straightforward, eh? Of
course, you still can construct a `CueSheet` manually. The data types are
defined in such a way that incorrect CUE sheets are impossible to represent.
