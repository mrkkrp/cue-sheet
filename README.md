## What is a CUE sheet?

> A cue sheet, or cue file, is a metadata file which describes how the
> tracks of a CD or DVD are laid out. Cue sheets are stored as plain text
> files and commonly have a “.cue” filename extension. CDRWIN first
> introduced cue sheets, which are now supported by many optical disc
> authoring applications and media players.
